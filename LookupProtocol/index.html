Oasis was a Manchester-based English rock band that established in 1991. Before becoming Oasis, they were known as the Rain and comprised of Liam Gallagher (lead vocals, tambourine), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Paul McGuigan (bass guitar), and Tony McCarroll (drums) (drums). When Liam's older brother Noel (lead guitar, vocals) returned to Manchester, he joined the band as a fifth member, completing the core line-up. They went through several lineup changes during the duration of their existence, but the Gallagher brothers remained the core members.
In 1993, Oasis signed with Creation Records, an independent record label, and released their chart-topping debut album Definitely Maybe (1994). In the middle of a chart competition with Britpop colleagues Blur, they recorded (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995) with drummer Alan White the next year. (What's the Story) Morning Glory? was an international chart hit and one of the best-selling albums of all time, spending 10 weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart. Furthermore, it is the fifth best-selling album in the United Kingdom and the biggest-selling record of the 1990s. The Gallagher brothers' feuds and wild lifestyles were frequently highlighted in tabloid tabloids. O
